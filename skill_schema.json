While specialist tasks can be transferrable across occupations and sectors, they are not universal - unlike core competencies. As such, specialist tasks are useful for differentiating occupations. Specialist tasks change more frequently than core competencies, making it possible to identify trends. This information adds to our understanding of how jobs may be changing in response to factors like increased digitisation or changing business models. Industry and employers can use the specialist tasks to define critical skills and identify skill gaps that could be met by learning on the job, short courses or accelerated training.
